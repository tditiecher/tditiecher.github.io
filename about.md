TDev.org is my personal website, a place to show my interests to the rest of the
world.
My name is Taco Ditiecher and I am a software developer at
[Greenchoice](http://www.greenchoice.nl).
Before that I was a software developer working for the
[City of Rotterdam](http://www.rotterdam.nl/) and for the Geomatics team at
[Petrotechnical Data Systems](http://www.pds.nl/).
My main focus is on the Microsoft.NET platform but once in a while I open my
eyes and have a look at other ecosystems like ruby and javascript.

When I'm not at my computer I probably can be found in the
[aikido dojo](http://aikidospijkenisse.nl/) practicing my own techniques or teaching children.

Thank you for your interest in me and my website,

Taco.
