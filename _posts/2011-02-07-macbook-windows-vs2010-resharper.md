Just a quick reminder for myselfâ€¦

Recently I bought myself a macbook pro but as I am a .NET developer I also
installed Win7 + VS2010 + Resharper. Until now I plugged in an external
USB-keyboard just to be able to press Alt+Ins (Resharper's shortcut for
Generate Code) as there is no Insert key on a macbook. Today I finally spent
a couple of minutes to find the key combination for the insert key so that
I don't need the other keyboard anymore.

```
Ins = Fn + Return
Alt+Ins = Fn+Option+return
```
