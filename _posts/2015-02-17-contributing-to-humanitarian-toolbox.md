title:  "Contributing to Humanitarian Toolbox"
---
After listening to a [.NET Rocks! podcast](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=808) where Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell talked with Tony Surma about the [Humanitarian Toolbox](https://htbox.org) initiative I decided to try to contribute to their [Crisis Checkin project](https://github.com/HTBox/crisischeckin). I created three pull requests in the last three days and it feels great to be able to help!

Taken from their website:
"The Crisis CheckIn Application is a system for automatically keeping track of who is responding to a particular emergency and automatically creating a "contact list"/"phone book" of those that are there. The service provides the location of the responder as well as their particular skillset. The Crisis CheckIn Application was inspired by Andrej Verity, seen here."
